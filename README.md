The account name "mynameisjef0" has been a name I have used for many years on the internet.
The repository only has this README.md file on it until future assignments.
I've download Github onto my desktop, created a seperate folder labeled as "Github" on my desktop, then I used the "clone" action on the application with the destination of this new folder to clone the repository to my computer.
